# NBA Shot Selection Analysis

## Introduction

Throughout the NBA's history, the types and distances of shots taken
        have drastically changed over time. With the introduction of the 3-point
        line in 1979, the NBA opened up a new opportunity for scoring. Although it
        took decades for players and teams to take advantage of this means of
        scoring, recent years seemed to have shown the merit and upside of 
        utilizing the 3-point line. This also has become a large topic of discussion
        since and an analysis could prove to be insightful on potential future
        trends.

In addition to understanding how the use of 3-point line has changed, we wanted to see how the shot selection or shot distance might impact a game. To guide our analysis, we broke down our tasks into 3 components:
- Understanding the progression of the Three-Point Revolution 
- Investigating other factors that might influence shot selection
- Determining if longer distance shots ultimately influence the outcome of the game
